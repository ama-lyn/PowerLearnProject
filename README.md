# ECOFARM

## Project Overview

Agriculture generates millions of tons of waste each year, primarily from farmers and vendors selling agricultural produce. Unfortunately, many farmers find themselves stuck in a cycle of waste, lacking access to the information and tools necessary to transform this waste into valuable products. As a result, they miss out on valuable additional income.

Thatâ€™s where ECOFARM comes in. ECOFARM is a web platform designed to help farmers convert waste into valuable products through easy step-by-step guides. It also enables them to buy and sell surplus goods, fostering community collaboration. By promoting sustainable practices, ECOFARM reduces environmental impact and improves farm productivity.
